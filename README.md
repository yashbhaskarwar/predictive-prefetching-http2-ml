# Predictive Prefetching using HTTP 2.0 and Machine Learning

This project predicts the next page a user will visit based on his behaviour on the website and prefetch its resources to improve page load time.

## Overview

1. Collect and represent user navigation data.
2. Train an LSTM model to predict the next page.
3. Serve the site through a Python backend.
4. Use predictions to prefetch the most likely next page and its assets.
